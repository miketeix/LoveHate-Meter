Twitter Love-Hater Meter
========================

Node.js application that collects streaming tweets containing the words Love and Hate, spits them onto a webpage via WebSocket connection, and broadcasts tweets-per-second to an arduino via serialport. 

The Arduino file is rigged to receive those values and accordingly activate two digitally addressable LED strips as if they were a meter oscillating between 0 and 100 (tweets/second).
